Removes repeated frames from pulldown on videos and batch of images

The code already contains both nodes on a single folder on your custom_nodes. Just call the node you need for IMAGES or VIDEOS

Ultra Nano Tutorial

remove_every: for example if you count 1,2,3,4 and 5 is the same frame as 4, then enter the value 5 on this field

start_from: for example, if frame 1 and 2 are the same, enter 2 on this field

The result should be smooth playback and reduce file size on outputs, as well as reduced calculation time on workflows like video to video etc.

Use nodes at the beginning or end of your workflow depending on what you need.
